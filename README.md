# SharingExpenses

This GitHub repository contains the source code that is used to build an Android app that allows users to track their shared expenses with a group of other users. Possible users of the app are a group of people who hang out/share flat/go on trips/go to parties etc. Users can create profiles, add other users to their friends list and create groups. Users can add bills with the list of bought items and their prices to the group's shared expense and distribute the expense among the group members. Users will be notified about how much they owe and asked to confirm. Users can track who owes them money and vice versa.
